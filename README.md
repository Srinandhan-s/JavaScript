# MERN Stack Training: JavaScript Tasks

This repository contains JavaScript tasks completed as part of my MERN stack training. These tasks cover a wide range of JavaScript concepts and techniques, focusing on practical applications to build a solid foundation for full-stack development. Below, you’ll find details about the topics covered, project structure, and purpose of this repository.

## **Topics Covered**

1. **Core JavaScript Concepts**  
   - Variables and data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, etc.)  
   - Operators and expressions  
   - Control structures (if-else, loops, switch-case)  

2. **Functions and Scopes**  
   - Function declarations and expressions  
   - Arrow functions (ES6+)  
   - Closures and lexical scoping  

3. **Arrays and Objects**  
   - Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, etc.)  
   - Object creation, manipulation, and destructuring  
   - Nested objects and arrays  

4. **ES6+ Features**  
   - Template literals  
   - Spread/rest operators  
   - Modules and imports/exports  
   - Promises and async/await  

5. **DOM Manipulation and Events**  
   - Selecting and modifying DOM elements  
   - Handling events and event listeners  
   - Dynamic content creation  

6. **Basic API Integration**  
   - Fetch API  
   - Working with JSON data  
   - Handling API responses and errors
